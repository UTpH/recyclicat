# Recyclicat
Technica Hack

Our submission to Technica 2018.

This was a 24hr hackathon where we built a web app called 'Recyclicat' that scans pictures of trash items and helps the user classify them as recyclable or non-recyclable.

# Motivation

USA is a world leader in most fields, including waste generation. As one of the most developed countries, it is important that it makes conscious efforts towards reducing the same.

We took a shot at the problem with first educating people about recycling by heloing them easily classify their trash. We also demoed a mock-up of a possibly gamified set-up where where the user is motivated to be more environmentally conscious during their purchases.
